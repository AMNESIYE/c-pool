## Instructions

Your repository must contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files (binary, temp files, obj files,...).

Don’t push your main function into your delivery directory, we will be adding
 our own. Your files will be compiled adding our ***main.c*** and our
  ***my_putchar.c*** files.

You are only allowed to use the ***my_putchar*** function to complete the
 following tasks, but don’t push it into your delivery directory, and don’t copy it in any of your delivered files.

If one of your files prevents you from compiling with ****.c***, the Autograder
 will not be able to correct your work and you will receive a 0.

## Coding Style

At ETNA, every C code must comply with our Coding Style: ***etna_c_coding_style
.pdf***.

Read it carefully! The code quality is an important factor and will be evaluated!

## Forbidden

Arrays and strings are forbidden for every task.

## Advise

Create your repository at the beginning of the day and submit your work on a
 regular basis! The delivery directory is specified within the instructions
  for each task. In order to keep your repository clean, pay attention to
   ***gitignore***.
